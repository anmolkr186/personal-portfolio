        <h1>About the project</h1>
        <p>There has been a recent growth in edu-tech industry in India with the onset of educational platforms like Unacademy and
        Byju's. These platforms are making online education really smooth and fulfilling for senior school students as well as
        competitive exams aspirants like IITJEE and NEET. But among the various classes/courses/study plans they offer, the
        skill development requirements of a students get lost somewhere, specifically for Indian students.</p>

        <p>
            Edudictive provides solutions in the edu-tech domain for school and college students who want to develop their skill in
            both technical and non-technical categories. It provides training programs such as web development, mobile development,
            UI/UX design, sales and finance, content and digital marketing, etc. I was approached by the company's founder to design
            the interface of their online platform. After over 8 months and multiple iterations, I have successfully completed the
            web design of this product which is currently under last stages of its development and is soon going to be released.
            Through this article, I am documenting my entire journey learning and implementing about the UI/UX design field.
        </p>

        <h1>Ideation and User Research</h1>
        <p>
            From the first day, the intent of the product was to target those students who want to build their skills and competency
            in non-academic fields. For eg. getting a major in Computer Science and developing successful web product using frontend
            and backend technologies are completely two difficult things. Even though having a degree definitely helps, one can
            develop a successful product even without it.
        </p>

        <p>
            I started to define a clear problem statement to reach this unexplored group of students which are not explored by other
            competitors in the market and ofcouse those who are not providing those features which thinking of releasing.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a fair bit of research and going across platforms like Coursera, Udemy, Unacademy, Byju's, CampK12 and many more.
            I got a fair bit of idea about direction we are going to proceed in. Although platforms like Udemy provide skill
            development courses in almost any field, there is rarely and follow-up or career benefit rate for the users. Other
            platforms mostly focused on school or college courses and not on acquiring a skill as such.
        </p>

        <p>The various expected stakeholders of this product as per our research can be broadly divided into:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>School students of classes 6th to 8th</strong> who have just started to explore the various cool things they can try. Parents play a huge role in deciding the programs for their children.</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>School students of classes 9th to 12th</strong> - Since most of the students of this age group are mostly focusing on preparation for competitive exams after their
            school, it is a difficult audience to reach out.</p></li>
            
            <li><p><strong>College Freshers or Sophomores</strong> - This group of students are generally found exploring their various options and fields to find which one they are
            actually interested in. Thus, this was one of the most important group for us.</p></li>

            <li><p><strong>College Juniors and Seniors</strong> - By this time, students are generally either expanding their skillset and are looking for a internships and jobs related
            to those skills.</p></li>

        </ul>

        <p>These groups have been developed and finalised after various iterations and it's not entirely based on our initial
        research. Moreover, since I was fairly new to user research and surveys at that time, the team decided to start off with
        our best guess about the audience and focuses more on building the product.</p>

        <h1>Information Architecture</h1>
        <p>The various sections of the website were layed out in this part of the design process. This was one of the most crucial
        steps as the developers also needed to get the idea about what I was trying to convey in a very structured manner. This
        way the backend developers could design the databases and other API integrations easily at the time when the frontend
        developers have started designing most of the static part of the website.</p>

    <h1>Low-fidelity wireframes</h1>
    <p>
        The team and I brainstormed a lot to work out the information architechture of each page. These sketches are hand drawn
        and aren't much detailed. They just give a basic understanding of design to convey the idea to the team members.
    </p>

    <h1>High-fidelity wireframes</h1>
    <p>
        Since the brand identity is in blue color significantly, I chose to stick with it as primary color. Furthermore, purple
        is chosen secondary colour. Apart from these, only black and white colours were chosen. The typoface selected for the
        entire design was Avenir and Proxima Nova. The illustraions were gathered from various sources under paid licenses.
